# Building a Dynamic Pivot Table in React (with Jspreadsheet)

This little React app takes a list of sales records and turns it into a pivot table — so you can instantly see totals grouped by things like year or region.

It uses the @jspreadsheet-ce/react library to show the data in spreadsheet form, and recalculates everything on the fly when you change how the data is grouped or summarized.

## How it works

1. Raw data → Objects → Groups → Pivot table
The base dataset lives in React state.
A useEffect converts rows into objects, groups them by the selected columns, and sums the chosen numeric field.
The result (pivotData) is just a 2D array:
the first row is headers, the rest are totals.
2. Two spreadsheets, side by side
One shows the raw data.
The other shows the computed pivot table.
3. The tricky part:
Jspreadsheet’s React wrapper doesn’t automatically re-render when you give it new data.
Even calling .setData() or .refresh() won’t help, because the internal instance is hidden from React.


## Next Steps / Suggestions
1. Optimize Performance
- For larger datasets, avoid remounting; instead, consider using the plain jspreadsheet-ce core API with manual .setData() updates.
2. Add Aggregation Options
- Extend beyond sum to support average, count, or max/min.
3. Persist User Choices
- Store selected group/aggregation settings in localStorage or a backend.
4. UI Improvements
- Add column sorting, chart visualizations, or export options using Jspreadsheet’s built-in plugins.
